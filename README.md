This project aims to clone the existing social media application: Twitter. Here I was able to focus exclusively on the code and how the technologies interfaced, as the design was already taken care of.

Back-end tasks included building a rest API, database management, JWT authentication with cookies, parsing upload information using Multer and interfacing with AWS S3 for secure image storage.

The project involved solving a few problems with regards to database relationships between Tweet (tweet-replies and re-tweets) and User (following and follower) models.

This was also my first time using Sass and the BEM class naming system, which helped better organise my CSS. Sass was especially useful for managing global colours as variables throughout the app.
